# Public REST API Version 2 for Executium (private beta)

## Accessibility
Currently executium version 2 is in private beta mode as of 10th June 2020. We will update the status of the public release date in this file when decided upon.

## General Information

* Version 2 is currently in private beta.
* The base endpoint is: **[CLOSED-BETA-VERSION]**
* All endpoints return either a JSON object or array.
* Data returned is limited by default to 10 rows and page 1 in descending order (newest first).
* Timestamp fields vary and are labeled to their corresponding contents of **milliseconds** or **time**

## HTTP Return Codes

* HTTP `4XX` return codes are used for malformed requests where the issue exists with the sender.
* HTTP `422` return code is applied when a user input is unexpected.
* HTTP `429` return code is used when breaking a request rate limit.
* HTTP `418` return code is used when an IP has been banned automatically for continuing to send requests after receiving `429` codes.
* HTTP `5XX` return codes are used for internal errors where the issue is with the executium side.

## Error Codes
* Any endpoint has the ability to return an ERROR

Sample Payload below:
```javascript

"data": {
  "code": 1440,
  "error": "Missing POST parameter(s) required to proceed, review 'missing_parameters' for more information."
},
   
```

* We provide a comprehensive run down on codes in [Errors Codes](./errors.md).

## General Information on Endpoints
* For `POST` endpoints, the parameters must be sent as a `query string` or in the `request body`.
* For `GET` endpoints, parameters must be sent as a `query string`.
* Parameters may be sent in any order.
* If a parameter sent in both the `query string` and `request body`, the `query string` parameter will take priority.
